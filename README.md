# etsy
I am conducting academic research on small online seller operations and digital marketplace management.

This application will access only the data of shops that explicitly authorize the app via Etsy’s OAuth process. The purpose is to analyze operational patterns such as sales trends, listing updates, and basic shop activity metrics for research purposes.

The research focuses on understanding seller behavior and operational efficiency in online marketplaces. The app will only retrieve the minimum data necessary for statistical analysis. No scraping will be performed, and no data will be resold, redistributed, or publicly exposed.

All analysis will be conducted in aggregate or anonymized form. Personally identifiable information (PII) will not be stored or published.

The API is required to access authorized shop data in a compliant and structured manner instead of manual data export.
